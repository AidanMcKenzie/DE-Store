# DE-Store
Completed as part of the Software Architecture module (SET10101) in the fourth year of the BEng Software Engineering (Hons) course within Edinburgh Napier University.

DE-Store is a prototype distributed business management system built using Java that adopts the use of the Three-tier Architecture. These layers are: User Interface Layer, Application Logic Layer and Data Access layer. DE-Store allows the user to manage a variety of different aspects of a retail branch, including controlling the price of products, enrolling customers on a loyalty card scheme and producing a report of the business' peformance.

The system utilises a MySQL database to store records for products, transactions, sales and customers, which is interfaced with using the JBDC API. All of the functionality present in the system uses database calls in some capacity.

The user interacts with the system using a command line interface and will generally select options and enter values.
